# Calculator
Building a calculator with basic functions.

Some of the code - especially the part of the button-creation - could be shorter by defining a function for the creation of buttons. Nonetheless this way is better for
me to understand the code visually and have access to each button instantly.

I am using Tkinter to create a "frontend". My inspiration for this calculator come from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXPyB4XeYLA&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org
